### **`SEC555 Portal Version: 1.0.0 #Beta`**
### **`Course Version C01_01`**

---

The goal of the SEC555 wiki is to increase the **in-class**, and, most importantly, **after-class** value of the course material. This wiki is, and likely always will be, very much a work in progress.

Contained in the wiki, you will find:
- Electronic Copies of the Lab Guides (**copy and paste, FTW!!!**)
- Tool and technique cheat sheets
...and more

Course/Lab/Wiki Bugs or Suggestions
----------

---

Please let us know if you find any bugs in the courseware/labs/wiki we need to squash. Also, reach out if you have suggestions to improve the course (e.g. content/labs/tools that should be added, removed, or updated). The easiest way to submit these improvements is by sending an email to **<justin@hasecuritysolutions.com>**
