**README BEFORE CONTINUING**

Individual logs in this lab are large. In fact, they can be between 10 and 500 times larger than traditional logs. This means that searching will take longer than previous labs.

This lab is based on Event IDs 4103 and 4104.

Exercise: No hints
==================

The goal of this lab is to identify all authorized vs unauthorized systems. Keep in mind the process being applied as the goal in production would be to automate your logic to find post compromise activities.

1.  Discover any systems generating significantly more PowerShell events than others.

2.  Identify all logs tagged with **possible\_base64\_encoding**.

    1.  What is the total count?

    2.  How many systems were using base64 encoded commands?

3.  Which system was compromised?

4.  What is the IP address of the command and control server?

5.  Event ID **4104**, which is for Script Block logging, logs commands as they are executed. These commands are logged at time of execution so they are decoded in the logs. Why do some logs contain base64 in the **ScriptBlockText** field?

6.  Using only logs from the non-compromised systems export a list of trusted cmdlets used.

Exercise â€“ Step-by-step instructions
====================================

Sometimes an analyst is privilege to a lot of data. However, data without context is meaningless. This lab presents a lot of data directly to the analyst with the goal being to piece it all together in a logical fashion. This logic is necessary to repeat investigations or to automate.

1. Identify which system(s) are generating significantly more PowerShell events than others
---------
Looking at the **Lab 4.2 - PowerShell Commands by Host** clearly shows that **IT02.sec555.com** is generating a ton of PowerShell logs. The number of logs from this host range in the **10s of thousands** where the next closet host only has **209** logs. This alone does not mean something malicious is going on. **IT02** is an IT computer and IT staff regularly use PowerShell. Investigation into **IT02** would be warranted though.

**Answer**: **IT02** is generating **22,411** events which is significantly higher than other systems. The next highest system only has **209** events.

2. Identify PowerShell logs dealing with base64 encoding
---------
Encoding is a technique used by attackers to evade security controls. Log aggregators can detect this during log ingestion. In this case, logs that look like they may contain base64 encoded were tagged with **possible\_base64\_encoding**. To search for these logs search for **tags:possible\_base64\_encoding**.

```bash
tags:possible_base64_encoding
```

<img src="./media/image4.png" width="402" height="36" />

The results show that there are **560** related script block logs and **492** related module logs for a total of **1,052**.

<img src="./media/image5.png" width="264" height="399" />

Looking at the **Lab 4.2 - PowerShell Commands by Host** graph shows that **IT02.sec555.com** is the only host using PowerShell with base64 encoding. This makes IT02 highly suspicious given it has base64 encoding and is generating a ton of PowerShell logs.

**Answer**: There are **1,052** events tagged with **possible\_base64\_encoding**. These came from **IT02.sec555.com**.
Keep your search filter for **step 3**.

3. Find out which system is compromised
---------
Having base64 encoding in PowerShell is highly suspicious. A next step could be to investigate the base64 commands by decoding them. Again, this is something a log aggregator should be able to do on the fly. The saved search called **Lab 4.2 - PowerShell with base64** **encoding** shows the decoded base64 strings in the field called **base64\_decoded**.

**Note**: The **Lab 4.2 - PowerShell with base64 encoding** and the **Lab 4.2 - PowerShell Script Block Logs** saved searches are saved so that logs show oldest to newest. This is helpful when analyzing events over a timeline.

Expand the first log in this saved search and look at the full base64\_decoded field.

<img src="./media/image6.png" width="690" height="117" />

There are multiple things wrong with this. First off, it originally was **base64 encoded**. Second, letters use an **improper mix of upper case** and **lower case letters** and it looks like upper case or lower case letters are used with a random internval. At a minimum it is not grammatically correct. Third, it is making a call out to the internet. Fourth, the call is to a **naked IP address**. Looking at the second and third logs show the **base64\_decoded** field is identical.

Scrolling down shows multiple functions being called repeatedly. Some are the same function for the same event such as the first three logs.

<img src="./media/image7.png" width="651" height="307" />

**Note**: This is because of the way module logging works. These are related to the same command but module logging is breaking out each module that is being invoked.

Next, look at the **Lab 4.2 - Module Use over Time**.

<img src="./media/image8.png" width="572" height="395" />

While there are spikes in use of certain cmdlets such as **Get-Random** there is a constant repetition of the use of **Start-Sleep**. You can see this by hovering over the dots associated with Start-Sleep.

**Note**: These will be the same color as Start-Sleep in the legend. In this diagram the legend for Start-Sleep is red. You can also find these by simply hovering over the many dots on the X axis.
To make this easier to see click on Start-Sleep and then click on the magnifying glass with the plus sign.

<img src="./media/image9.png" width="156" height="103" />

You should now see the following graph:

<img src="./media/image10.png" width="466" height="387" />

With so many data points close together it is easier to analyze the time of events in a table. You can do this by clicking on the up arrow found at the bottom of the graph.

<img src="./media/image11.png" width="517" height="103" />

This will then display additional information about the graph. The default view is a table view with timestamps. Notice the timestamps are typically **5 seconds apart**.

<img src="./media/image12.png" width="497" height="417" />

While not always exactly 5 seconds apart, it is close to this. This can be a form of command and control beaconing. The times where things are not exactly 5 seconds apart are likely points where commands were issued from the command and control server.

**Note**: The time reflected on your system may be different depending on what time zone the system is that is using Kibana.

Remove the filter for **command\_name.raw:"Start-Sleep"** by hovering over it and clicking on the garbage can icon.

<img src="./media/image13.png" width="482" height="79" />

Next, see if are other base64 encoded commands. You can do this by expanding the first log in **Lab 4.2 - PowerShell with base64 encoding** visualization and then click on the magnifying glass with the minus sign on the **shell\_host\_application\_length** field with the value of **1,378**.

<img src="./media/image14.png" width="362" height="49" />

The remaining logs are mostly garbled mess. This is typically due to encryption or the contents being binary. However, the top two logs have some cleartext.

<img src="./media/image15.png" width="685" height="253" />

The first log looks like the contents of a default web page. The second log represents a binary executable being transferred. This is highly abnormal. Executables transferred to a system by hiding the binary in base64 encoding is highly suspicious and common for malware. This is often associated with a stage two download. Given all the evidence found so far, **IT02** is likely compromised.

**Note**: The MZ character at the beginning stands for **Mark Zbikowski**. This is the magic byte signifying a file is an EXE file. **This program cannot be run in DOS mode** is another indication that this is an EXE.

**Answer**: Evidence suggests that **IT02** is compromised.

Keep the current search filters until the end of **step 5**.

4. Identify the IP address of the command and control server
---------
This was previously discovered in step 3. When analyzing the base64\_decoded field you see that IT02 is making web calls out to **24.17.92.107**.

<img src="./media/image16.png" alt="C:\Users\JHENDE~1\AppData\Local\Temp\SNAGHTML3d30238.PNG" width="646" height="71" />

**Answer**: The command and control server is at **24.17.92.107**.

5. Find out why some logs contain base64 in the ScriptBlockText field
---------
The content of the **ScriptBlockText** field contains only executed PowerShell code. This means it is the code executed at runtime. However, some of the logs contain what looks to be base64 encoded data in this field. For example, the third log looks like the **ScriptBlockText** field contains nothing but base64 contents.

<img src="./media/image17.png" alt="C:\Users\JHENDE~1\AppData\Local\Temp\SNAGHTML452463c.PNG" width="661" height="429" />

The **ScriptBlockId** field is the unique ID generated per block of executed code. When multiple logs share the same **ScriptBlockId** it means they are part of the same block of code being ran. This happens if the code being executed is so long it cannot fit in one event log. In this case, the second and third log displayed are part of the same code block.

<img src="./media/image18.png" width="659" height="427" />

Using the scroll bar at the bottom of the Lab 4.2 - PowerShell Script Block Logs reveals some additional fields.

<img src="./media/image19.png" width="506" height="433" />

As you can see the 2<sup>nd</sup> log is the 10<sup>th</sup> log in **ScriptBlockId** **59fd7a81-ef18-42b3-918b-0c32c854ea00**. The 3<sup>rd</sup> log is the 11<sup>th</sup> log in **ScriptBlockId 59fd7a81-ef18-42b3-918b-0c32c854ea00**.

**Note**: Sometimes the **message**\_number field is out of sequence. This is because the time collected is not in milliseconds.

Knowing this, expand the 2<sup>nd</sup> log and look at the ScriptBlockText section to find out what commands are being ran before the base64 content in the 3<sup>rd</sup> log.

<img src="./media/image20.png" width="399" height="257" />

This shows that the base64 string is being loaded into a variable called **$PEBytes64**. While still on the 2<sup>nd</sup> log, scroll down further and look at the base64\_decoded field.

<img src="./media/image21.png" width="517" height="106" />

This shows that a binary executable is being stored into **$PEBytes64**. This is a common technique used to bypass certain antivirus and application whitelisting products. By loading an executable into a variable and then calling it the contents never are written to disk.

**Answer**: The base64 strings found in the **ScriptBlockText** field are properly being rendered. This base64 string was part of the executed code being ran. In this case, a base64 encoded executable is being stored into **$PEBytes64**.

Undo all search filters by re-loading the dashboard. Click on **Dashboard** and then **Load Saved Dashboard**. Type **4.2** in the search filter and then click on **Lab 4.2 - PowerShell Dashboard**.

<img src="./media/image3.png" width="672" height="139" />

6. Use logs from non-compromised systems to export a list of trusted cmdlets
---------
One technique that works well for monitoring for abnormal PowerShell as well as filtering noisy PowerShell logs is whitelisting trusted cmdlets. This can be done by monitoring systems under "trusted conditions" and then exporting the list of all cmdlets used.

**Note**: Some cmdlets should only be trusted by subnet. For example, IT staff will likely use cmdlets that should never been seen on standard systems.

The **Lab 4.2 - cmdlets visualization** provides a list of all cmdlets used. However, it contains cmdlets from **IT02.sec555.com** which is compromised. To list only cmdlets used on non-compromised systems search for **-hostname.raw:"IT02.sec555.com"**

```bash
-hostname.raw:"IT02.sec555.com"
```

<img src="./media/image22.png" width="380" height="38" />

Then click on either **Raw** or **Formatted** in the **Lab 4.2 - cmdlets visualization** to export the list of cmdlets used.

<img src="./media/image23.png" width="285" height="411" />

**Answer**: To export a list of trusted cmdlets to use as a starting point for whitelisting cmdlets filter out **IT02.sec555.com** and then click on **Formatted** in the **Lab 4.2 - cmdlets** visualization. This will provide a CSV file with all the trusted cmdlets.

Bonus Challenge 2 â€“ Attack Framework
====================================

Sometimes attack tools leave behind traces that identify which tool was used. What attack framework was used for command and control of the victim machine?

**Hint**: There are traces that clearly identify the attack framework used.

Bonus Challenge 3 â€“ Compromise
==============================

What file was executed that led to the initial compromise?
