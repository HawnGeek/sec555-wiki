====================================

**Setting up the Stage**
Logs for this lab have already been ingested and are stored in index **lab2.1-complete**. To answer the questions below use Kibana.

To access this first open Kibana and change the index to **lab2.1-complete**.

<img src="./media/image2.png" width="260" height="163" />

All events for this lab occurred during **April 11, 2017**. To view the logs, click on the time picker in the top right. Then click on **Absolute** and enter in **2017-04-11 00:00:00.000** for the **From:** field and **2017-04-11 23:00:00:00.000** for the **To:** field. Then click on **Go**.

<img src="./media/image3.png" width="643" height="266" />

After clicking **Go** the time picker should reflect **April 11<sup>th</sup> 2017, 00:00:00.000 to April 11<sup>th</sup> 2017, 23:00:00.000**.

<img src="./media/image4.png" width="291" height="32" />

Minimize the time picker by clicking the arrow pointing up at the bottom.

1. Setup a visualization to view systems requesting DNS sinkholes
---------
**Note:** A DNS sinkhole is used to take known bad domain requests and point them to a different IP address. For instance, if evil.com is a malicious domain an internal DNS can be set to be authoritative for the domain and to always replay to requests with **0.0.0.0** or a specific IP address. Lab Me Inc. has decided to use a DNS sinkhole of **0.0.0.0**. This is a preventative technique. However, looking for the sinkhole IP makes it also a detective technology.

Click on **Visualize** to create a new Visualization.

<img src="./media/image6.png" width="371" height="43" />

You should see this screen:

<img src="./media/image7.png" width="652" height="185" />

If you do not see the image above on your screen you need to click on the **New Visualization** button.

<img src="./media/image8.png" width="541" height="68" />

Click on **Vertical bar chart**.

<img src="./media/image9.png" width="341" height="104" />

Then click on **From a new search**.

<img src="./media/image10.png" width="276" height="113" />

Select **lab2.1-complete** for the index.

<img src="./media/image11.png" width="284" height="189" />

For this visualization to work properly it needs to only represent DNS sinkhole requests. To do this set the search filter to **tags:dns\_sinkhole** and click on the search icon.

```bash
tags:dns_sinkhole
```

<img src="./media/image12.png" width="606" height="53" />

**Note**: This tag was created using the Logstash code below.

```javascript
if [answers] == "0.0.0.0" {
  mutate { 
    add_tag => [ "dns_sinkhole" ] 
  }
}
```

Next click on **X-Axis**.

<img src="./media/image13.png" width="276" height="158" />

Then select **Terms** for **Aggregation** and **highest\_registered\_domain** for the **Field**. Then set the **CustomLabel** to **Domain**. Then, click on **Add sub-buckets**.

<img src="./media/image14.png" width="276" height="352" />

Select **Split Bars** for bucket type.

<img src="./media/image15.png" width="247" height="88" />

Set **Sub Aggregation** to **Terms**, **Field** to **source\_ip**, and **CustomLabel** to **Source IP**. Then click on the Green play button.

<img src="./media/image16.png" width="269" height="403" />

You should be rewarded with this screen:

<img src="./media/image17.png" width="470" height="425" />

**Answer** - This shows **10.5.55.100** had a DNS request to a blacklisted domain called **help-setting.info**.

**Note**: It should not be normal for internal systems to be requesting blacklisted domains. If this happens you should investigate the system to find out why it requested the domain. This also means that deploying this technique in production ideally will display an empty graph or table.

Save the visualization by clicking on the save icon. Set the **Title** to **DNS Sinkhole Requests** and click **Save**.

<img src="./media/image18.png" width="364" height="126" />

2. Find anomalous DNS use by charting out the \# of DNS request types
---------
Start by clicking on the **new visualization icon**.

<img src="./media/image8.png" width="541" height="68" />

Click on **Vertical bar chart**.

<img src="./media/image9.png" width="341" height="104" />

Then click on **From a new search**.

<img src="./media/image10.png" width="276" height="113" />

Select **lab2.1-complete** for the index.

<img src="./media/image11.png" width="284" height="189" />

Since this visualization uses all DNS logs no search filter needs applied. Next click on **X-Axis**.

<img src="./media/image13.png" width="276" height="158" />

Then select **Terms** for **Aggregation** and **query\_type\_name.raw** for the **Field**. Then set the **CustomLabel** to **Query Type**. Then, click on **Add sub-buckets**.

**Note**: The reason for using **query\_type\_name.raw** instead of **query\_type\_name** is that **.raw** represents an unindexed value. This means it will use the exact field values which is what you want.

<img src="./media/image19.png" width="268" height="352" />

Select **Split Bars** for bucket type.

<img src="./media/image15.png" width="247" height="88" />

Then select **Terms** for **Sub** **Aggregation** and **highest\_registered\_domain** for the **Field**. Then set the **CustomLabel** to **Domain**. Then, click on the green play button.

<img src="./media/image20.png" width="273" height="396" />

You should now see the completed chart.

<img src="./media/image21.png" width="495" height="424" />

**Answer** - In this case **covertc2.com** has an enormous amount of **TXT**, **CNAME**, and **MX** records compared to other domains. The domain **google.com** has the highest amount of **A** records.

**Note**: In this case **covertc2.com** was being used as a DNS tunnel. It was performed using **dnscat2** which uses IPsec to send encrypted data over DNS **TXT**, **CNAME**, and **MX** records. To better identify DNS tunneling it may be helpful to create another chart showing DNS requests over time by source IP address.

Save the visualization by clicking on the save icon. Set the **Title** to **DNS Query Type by Domain** and click **Save**.

<img src="./media/image22.png" width="381" height="124" />

3. Setup a frequency analysis visualization to find adversaries trying to evade detection with random domain names
---------
#### 3a) This visualization will be based on the parent\_domain field

Start by clicking on the **new visualization icon**.

<img src="./media/image8.png" width="541" height="68" />

Click on **Data table**.

<img src="./media/image23.png" width="352" height="126" />

Then click on **From a new search**.

<img src="./media/image10.png" width="276" height="113" />

Select **lab2.1-complete** for the index.

<img src="./media/image11.png" width="284" height="189" />

Then click on **Split Rows**.

<img src="./media/image24.png" width="176" height="83" />

Set **Aggregation** to **Terms**, **Field** to **parent\_domain\_frequency\_score**, **Order By** to **Term**, **Order** to **Ascending**, **Size** to **10**, and **CustomLabel** to **Frequency Score**. Then click on **Add sub-buckets**.

<img src="./media/image25.png" width="264" height="348" />

Click on **Split Rows**.

<img src="./media/image24.png" width="176" height="83" />

Set **Sub Aggregation** to **Terms**, **Field** to **parent\_domain.raw**, and **CustomLabel** to **Domain**. Then click on the green play button.

<img src="./media/image26.png" width="311" height="396" />

You should now have the complete table showing **parent domains** with the lowest frequency score or highest chance of being random.

<img src="./media/image27.png" width="435" height="262" />

**Answer** – The primary domain with the lowest frequency score is **tbs-wroclaw.com.pl**.

Save this visualization by clicking on the save icon. Set the **Title** to **DNS Frequency Scores on Parent Domain**. Then click **Save**.

<img src="./media/image28.png" width="696" height="124" />

#### 3b) Setup a frequency analysis visualization to find adversaries trying to evade detection with random domain names. This visualization will be based on the subdomain field

Start by clicking on the **new visualization icon**.

<img src="./media/image8.png" width="541" height="68" />

Click on **Data table**.

<img src="./media/image23.png" width="352" height="126" />

Then click on **From a new search**.

<img src="./media/image10.png" width="276" height="113" />

Select **lab2.1-complete** for the index.

<img src="./media/image11.png" width="284" height="189" />

Then click on **Split Rows**.

<img src="./media/image24.png" width="176" height="83" />

Set **Aggregation** to **Terms**, **Field** to **subdomain\_frequency\_score**, **Order By** to **Term**, **Order** to **Ascending**, **Size** to **10**, and **CustomLabel** to **Frequency Score**. Then click on **Add sub-buckets**.

<img src="./media/image29.png" width="269" height="347" />

Set **Sub Aggregation** to **Terms**, the **Field** to **subdomain.raw**, and **CustomLabel** to **Subdomain**. Then click the green play button at the top of the screen.

<img src="./media/image30.png" width="270" height="399" />

You should now see the table for lowest frequency subdomains.

<img src="./media/image31.png" width="469" height="261" />

**Answer** – The **subdomain** with the lowest frequency score is **1aw2nml**.

Save the visualization by clicking on the save icon. Set the **Title** to **DNS Frequency Scores on Subdomains** and click **Save**.

<img src="./media/image32.png" alt="C:\Users\JHENDE~1\AppData\Local\Temp\SNAGHTML4bc1d83.PNG" width="544" height="159" />

4. Find the domain used to phish **labmeinc.com**. Establish a way to catch this ongoing
---------
Switch back to the discover tab and search for **labmeinc.com~**.

```bash
labmeinc.com~
```

<img src="./media/image33.png" width="632" height="71" />

Immediately you will see results for **1abmeinc.com**. Notice the starting character is the number **1** not the letter **L**.

**Answer** – The phishing domain is **1abmeinc.com**

This search can be saved and used to visually identify phishing domains being used. To do this click on the save icon. Set the **Save Search** title to **DNS Internal phishing domain matches** and click **Save**.

<img src="./media/image34.png" width="408" height="142" />

Switch back to Visualize and click on the **new visualization icon**.

<img src="./media/image35.png" width="474" height="67" />

Click on **Health Color Metric**

<img src="./media/image36.png" width="310" height="92" />

Click on **From a saved search**

<img src="./media/image37.png" width="287" height="104" />

Click on **DNS Internal phishing domain matches**.

<img src="./media/image38.png" width="305" height="104" />

**Note**: This will tell the visualization to use the previously saved search filter. Updating the saved search will update any visualizations linked to it.

Now click on **Options**, set the **Critical threshold** to **1**, check **Invert scale**, and click on the green play icon.

<img src="./media/image39.png" width="268" height="324" />

What this does is create a color-coded visualization. If there are zero phishing domains found, then the number 0 will be displayed in a green box. If one or more logs exists showing a phishing domain is in use, then the box will be red and display a count of how many logs were found.

<img src="./media/image40.png" width="266" height="230" />

Save the visualization by clicking on the save icon. Set the **Title** to **DNS Fuzzy Domain Matches** and click **Save**.

<img src="./media/image41.png" width="654" height="122" />

5. Take all previously saved visualizations and make a DNS dashboard
---------
Click on **Dashboard** at the top of the screen. Then click on the **New Dashboard** icon and then the **Add Visualization** icon.

<img src="./media/image42.png" width="473" height="64" />

Add the visualizations to the dashboard by clicking on their names. Add them in the following order:

1. **DNS Query Type by Domain**
2. **DNS Fuzzy Domain Matches**
3. **DNS Sinkhole Requests**
4. **DNS Frequency Scores on Parent Domain**
5. **DNS Frequency Scores on Subdomains**

<img src="./media/image43.png" width="404" height="242" />

You can then resize each visualization on the dashboard by dragging the window using the symbol in the bottom right corner of each visualization. You have to hover over the visualization for it to appear.

<img src="./media/image44.png" width="265" height="174" />

Resize the windows to make the dashboard look similar to below. Your luck may vary based on screen size.

<img src="./media/image45.png" width="665" height="409" />

Now save the dashboard by clicking the save icon and setting the **Save As** title to **DNS Dashboard**. Then click **Save**. Congratulations. You now have a simple yet affective tactical dashboard. This is a basic example that can still be extremely effective.

<img src="./media/image46.png" width="434" height="158" />

**Note**: A little trick worth knowing is to add a saved search to the bottom of a dashboard. Dashboards in Kibana are for the most part interactive. This means if you click on something it will apply it as a search filter and all dashboard will update to reflect it. However, sometimes the dashboard does not show all the details you want. If you add a saved search to the bottom of the dashboard you can simply scroll down and look at the logs. You can see this by opening the dashboard called “**Lab 2.1 – DNS Dashboard**”.

<img src="./media/image47.png" width="408" height="140" />

Then scroll to the bottom and you will see the DNS logs underneath the dashboard.

<img src="./media/image48.png" width="586" height="433" />

This allows you to start an investigation directly from a dashboard. You will not need to switch back to the **Discover** tab.

#### **Bonus Challenge 1 – Finding systems with default settings**

The **lab2.1-complete** index contains a system using default Windows SNTP settings. Which box is it?

#### **Bonus Challenge 2 – DNS time-to-live**

The lab2.1-complete index contains multiple domains with low TTLs.
1. Which domain has a TTL of 0? Why would it use a TTL of zero?
2. Which domain has 23 counts of a TTL of 5? Any guess as it if this domain is good or bad and why?
